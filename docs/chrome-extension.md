# Chrome Extension — Job Capture

## Purpose

A Chrome extension that captures job posting data (title, company, JD URL) directly
from your browser and inserts it into the `applications` table via the existing
`add_application()` function. Eliminates manual Google Form entry when saving or
logging a job you applied to.

---

## Architecture

```
Chrome Extension (laptop)
        │
        │  POST /add-application  (JSON)
        │  http://localhost:5001   ← SSH tunnel (testing)
        │  https://yourdomain.com  ← production
        ▼
Flask API  —  api.py  (Oracle VM, port 5000)
        │
        │  calls
        ▼
db/applications.py → add_application() → PostgreSQL
```

---

## Deployment Phases

### Phase 1 — Testing via SSH tunnel
Run this on your laptop before using the extension:
```bash
ssh -L 5001:localhost:5000 ubuntu@<VM-IP> -N
```
- Flask runs on VM port 5000
- Tunnel forwards your laptop's port 5001 → VM port 5000
- Extension calls `http://localhost:5001` — Chrome treats localhost as secure, no HTTPS needed
- Tunnel drops if terminal closes; run in a background session or tmux

### Phase 2 — Production via domain (Option C)
Once your domain is pointed at the VM and SSL is configured:
- Extension calls `https://yourdomain.com/add-application`
- No tunnel needed; works from any network

---

## Installation — Multiple Laptops

The extension is not published to the Chrome Web Store. It loads as an **unpacked
extension** in Chrome developer mode — a 2-minute setup per laptop:

1. Open `chrome://extensions`
2. Toggle **Developer mode** on (top-right)
3. Click **Load unpacked** → select the `chrome-extension/` folder from the repo
4. Done

**The repo does the heavy lifting.** Since `chrome-extension/` lives inside the
project repo, any laptop with the repo cloned already has the extension files.
`git pull` on the new laptop → Load unpacked. No copying files around.

**No per-device settings to configure.** User identity is detected automatically
from the signed-in Google account display name (see §7). The only one-time setup
is the Google Cloud Console OAuth registration — done once by the developer,
not per user or per device.

**If the manual setup becomes annoying** (3+ laptops regularly): publish as an
unlisted private app on the Chrome Web Store ($5 one-time developer fee, quick review).
It then installs and auto-updates across all Chrome devices on sign-in.

---

## Design Decisions

### 1. UI approach — Injected overlay (not Chrome action popup)

The extension injects a floating panel directly into the job page's DOM rather than
using Chrome's built-in action popup (`popup.html`). 

**Why:** Chrome MV3 restricts programmatic popup opening (`chrome.action.openPopup()`
is unreliable for auto-triggering). An injected overlay works identically for both
auto-trigger and manual-trigger flows, and doesn't require the user to click the
extension icon for it to appear.

The overlay is a fixed-position `<div>` injected at the bottom-right of the page.
It can be dismissed with Escape or a close button.

### 2. Trigger mechanism

**Auto-trigger (known ATS pages):**
- Content script loads only on allowlisted ATS domains (enforced by `manifest.json`)
- Starts a **4-second** focus timer on page load
- If the tab stays focused for 4 seconds → overlay appears pre-filled
- If tab loses focus or user navigates away → timer cancels, nothing happens
- Implementation: `setTimeout` + `document.addEventListener('visibilitychange', ...)`

**Manual trigger (any page, including non-allowlisted career sites):**
- User clicks the extension icon
- `background.js` receives the click via `chrome.action.onClicked`
- Background uses `chrome.scripting.executeScript` to inject `content.js` into
  the active tab on demand
- `content.js` extracts data and immediately injects the overlay (no 4s delay)

### 3. Data extraction — priority order

**Job Title:**
1. JSON-LD `<script type="application/ld+json">` with `@type: "JobPosting"` → `title`
2. ATS-specific CSS selector (lookup table keyed by hostname)
3. `document.title` — almost always contains the job title as the first segment

**Company Name:**
Extracted from URL structure for known ATS platforms:

| ATS | URL pattern | Extracted from |
|-----|-------------|---------------|
| Greenhouse | `boards.greenhouse.io/stripe/jobs/123` | `pathname.split('/')[1]` |
| Lever | `jobs.lever.co/stripe/uuid` | `pathname.split('/')[1]` |
| Ashby | `jobs.ashbyhq.com/stripe/uuid` | `pathname.split('/')[1]` |
| Workday | `stripe.wd1.myworkdayjobs.com` | `hostname.split('.')[0]` |
| SmartRecruiters | `careers.smartrecruiters.com/Stripe/` | `pathname.split('/')[1]` |
| LinkedIn | JSON-LD `hiringOrganization.name` | structured data |
| Indeed | JSON-LD `hiringOrganization.name` | structured data |

Fallback: `<meta property="og:site_name">` content attribute.

All extracted company names go through `.replace(/-/g, ' ')` and title-case
normalization before display in the overlay (user can edit before submitting).

**URL:**
`window.location.href` — always the JD page URL (not the apply URL). Preferred
because it contains the job description and is stable.

### 4. Default application status

The overlay shows a status dropdown. Default is **Active (Applied)** since the most
common use case is logging a job you just applied to. Options:

| Dropdown label | DB value | Use case |
|---------------|----------|---------|
| Active (Applied) | `active` | Just applied — pipeline starts working it |
| Prospective (Save for later) | `prospective` | Interested but haven't applied yet |

### 6. Duplicate URL handling

`add_application()` returns `(app_id, created)` where `created=False` means the
URL already exists. The overlay shows:

- `created=True` → green: **"Added to pipeline (ID: 42)"** → auto-closes in 2s
- `created=False` → yellow: **"Already in pipeline (ID: 42)"** → stays open
- VM unreachable → yellow: **"Saved to sheet — will sync automatically"** → auto-closes in 2s
- Both VM and sheet unreachable → red: **"Failed to save. Check your connection."**
- Missing required field → inline field highlight (red border + label below field)

### 7. User identification — who applied?

The pipeline is multi-user and both users may share the same device. Per-device
or per-profile config doesn't work for a shared laptop.

**Design: auto-detect from Google display name, with manual override.**

The extension calls `chrome.identity.getAuthToken({interactive: false})` silently,
then hits `https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/userinfo` to get the display name
of whoever is signed into Chrome (e.g. `"Rutvi Mavani"`). It matches that name
against the user list in `config.js` using a case-insensitive substring check.

```js
// config.js
const USERS = [
  { id: 1, nameMatch: "rutvi" },
  { id: 2, nameMatch: "other persons first name" }
];
```

The overlay always shows an "Applying as" dropdown, pre-selected automatically:

```
Applying as: [ Rutvi ▼ ]   ← auto-detected, correct 99% of the time
```

User can change it from the dropdown if detection picked the wrong person.

**Why display name over email:**
- You use multiple Google accounts — the active account in Chrome may be a work
  account or secondary account with a different email
- Display name ("Rutvi Mavani") stays consistent across all your accounts
- Substring match (`"rutvi"` in `"Rutvi Mavani"`) is robust to name format variations

**Fallback if detection fails** (not signed in, token error, name not in config):
- Dropdown shows with no pre-selection — user picks manually
- No crash, no broken state

**One-time setup required:**
- Register the extension in Google Cloud Console as an OAuth 2.0 client
  (type: Chrome Extension) — free, ~15 minutes, done once by the developer
- Add the client ID to `manifest.json` under `"oauth2"`
- After this: completely automatic on every device, no per-user configuration

**`user_id` is sent directly in the request body** — server needs no mapping logic,
just stores whatever `user_id` the extension sends.

### 8. Authentication

**Testing phase (SSH tunnel):** No auth. The SSH tunnel is the security boundary.

**Production phase (domain):** Single shared API key. Stored in `.env` on the VM
as `EXTENSION_API_KEY` and hardcoded in `chrome-extension/config.js` (which lives
in your private repo — no more exposed than `.env`). Flask checks the
`X-API-Key` header; mismatches return `401`. If `EXTENSION_API_KEY` is not set,
the check is skipped (testing env).

Auth and identity are now separate concerns:
- **Auth** (is this request from our extension?): shared API key
- **Identity** (who is applying?): `user_id` field in the request body, set by the user selector

### 10. Fetch timeout + Google Sheets fallback

`fetch()` to the Flask API has a **10-second timeout** via `AbortController`. On
timeout or network error, the extension falls back to writing the job row directly
to the existing Google Sheet ("Responses" tab, same sheet `form_sync.py` reads).
The existing cron that runs `form_sync.py` picks it up on its next run — no new
cron or tab needed.

**Fallback column format** (same as existing Google Form responses):
```
Timestamp | Company Name | Job URL | Job Title | Applied Date
```

**Note:** The sheet currently has no `user_id` column. The fallback always writes
without `user_id` and `form_sync.py` inserts with its default (`user_id=1`). This
will be wrong for User 2's fallback entries. A 6th `User ID` column will be added
to the sheet later — `form_sync.py` will be updated at that point to read it.
Until then, any fallback entries from User 2 must be manually re-attributed.

The extension needs `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets` scope added to
the OAuth config in `manifest.json` (alongside `userinfo.profile` already there).

### 11. SPA navigation (LinkedIn, Indeed)

LinkedIn Jobs and Indeed are single-page apps — clicking from one job to another
changes the URL via `pushState` but does not reload the page. The content script
stays alive but the 4-second timer already fired and won't re-trigger naturally.

**Fix:** Intercept `history.pushState` and listen for `popstate` events. On each
URL change that still matches the ATS pattern, reset and re-arm the 4-second timer.
Also clear any existing overlay before re-injecting on the new page.

```js
const _push = history.pushState.bind(history);
history.pushState = (...args) => { _push(...args); onUrlChange(); };
window.addEventListener('popstate', onUrlChange);
```

### 12. Overlay already open guard

If the auto-trigger fires and the user also clicks the icon manually, two overlays
would stack. Before injecting, check if one already exists:

```js
if (document.getElementById('job-capture-overlay')) {
  document.getElementById('job-capture-overlay').focus();
  return;
}
```

### 13. Endpoint URL — testing vs production

The API endpoint is controlled by a single flag in `config.js`:

```js
const PROD = false;  // ← flip to true when moving to production
const API_URL = PROD
  ? "https://yourdomain.com/add-application"
  : "http://localhost:5001/add-application";
```

Switching environments: edit `PROD`, then click **Reload** on the extension card
in `chrome://extensions`. No other changes needed.

### 14. `api.py` process management on the VM

`api.py` runs as a `systemd` service alongside the main pipeline — always-on,
auto-restarts on crash, survives VM reboots. A `nohup` one-liner is an alternative
for quick testing but dies on reboot.

The systemd unit file lives at `/etc/systemd/system/pipeline-api.service`. Starting
it: `sudo systemctl start pipeline-api`. Logs: `journalctl -u pipeline-api -f`.

### 15. CORS

Flask must accept requests from the Chrome extension origin
(`chrome-extension://<extension-id>`). Using `flask-cors` with
`origins=["chrome-extension://*"]` is the cleanest approach. Added to `api.py`
only — no changes to existing code.

## Flask API — `api.py`

Single endpoint. Thin wrapper around `add_application()`.

**Request:**
```json
POST /add-application
Content-Type: application/json
X-API-Key: <shared-key>   ← omit during SSH tunnel testing

{
  "company":   "Stripe",
  "job_url":   "https://boards.greenhouse.io/stripe/jobs/123",
  "job_title": "Senior Engineer",
  "status":    "active",
  "user_id":   1
}
```

`user_id` is always sent explicitly in the body — resolved client-side from the
Google display name match. Server stores it as-is, no mapping needed.

**Responses:**
```json
201 Created
{ "id": 42, "created": true }

200 OK  (duplicate)
{ "id": 42, "created": false }

400 Bad Request  (missing required field)
{ "error": "company is required" }

401 Unauthorized  (wrong API key)
{ "error": "unauthorized" }
```

Required fields: `company`, `job_url`. Everything else has defaults
(`job_title=null`, `status="active"`, `user_id=1`).

`api.py` lives at the project root and imports from `db.applications` the same
way `main.py` does. Started separately from the main pipeline:
```bash
python api.py          # runs on 0.0.0.0:5000
```

## Chrome Extension

### `manifest.json`

```json
{
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "name": "Job Pipeline Capture",
  "version": "1.0",
  "permissions": ["activeTab", "scripting", "storage", "identity"],
  "oauth2": {
    "client_id": "<your-client-id-from-google-cloud-console>",
    "scopes": [
      "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile",
      "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets"
    ]
  },
  "background": {
    "service_worker": "background.js"
  },
  "content_scripts": [{
    "matches": [
      "*://boards.greenhouse.io/*",
      "*://jobs.lever.co/*",
      "*://jobs.ashbyhq.com/*",
      "*://*.myworkdayjobs.com/*",
      "*://careers.smartrecruiters.com/*",
      "*://www.linkedin.com/jobs/*",
      "*://www.indeed.com/viewjob*"
    ],
    "js": ["config.js", "content.js"],
    "css": ["overlay.css"]
  }],
  "action": {
    "default_title": "Capture this job"
  }
}
```

No `default_popup` — icon click is handled by `background.js` instead.
`config.js` is loaded before `content.js` so the user list and API endpoint
are available as globals.

### `background.js` responsibilities

- Listen for `chrome.action.onClicked` (icon click)
- Use `chrome.scripting.executeScript` to inject `content.js` into the active tab
- Also inject `overlay.css` via `chrome.scripting.insertCSS`
- Send a message to the tab telling `content.js` to skip the 4s delay and show
  the overlay immediately

### `content.js` responsibilities

- On load (auto-trigger flow): start 4s focus timer; cancel on `visibilitychange`
- On message from background (manual-trigger flow): skip timer, extract immediately
- Extract title, company, URL using the priority chain above
- Inject the overlay `<div>` into `document.body`
- On form submit: `fetch()` POST to the configured endpoint
- Handle all response states (success, duplicate, error) by updating overlay UI
- On Escape key or close button: remove overlay from DOM

### Overlay fields

| Field | Type | Pre-filled | Required |
|-------|------|-----------|---------|
| Applying as | dropdown | auto-detected via Google display name | yes |
| Job Title | text input | extracted from page | no |
| Company | text input | extracted from URL/JSON-LD | yes |
| URL | text input (readonly) | `window.location.href` | yes |
| Status | dropdown | Active (Applied) | yes |

URL is read-only — it's the dedup key in the DB. If the wrong URL was captured,
dismiss and navigate to the correct page before triggering again.

## SSH Tunnel Setup (Testing)

```bash
# Run once before using the extension. Keep terminal open (or use tmux).
ssh -L 5001:localhost:5000 ubuntu@<VM-IP> -N

# Verify tunnel is working:
curl http://localhost:5001/health
# → {"status": "ok"}
```

Extension endpoint during testing: `http://localhost:5001`
Extension endpoint in production: `https://yourdomain.com`

The endpoint URL is hardcoded in `content.js` for now. Configurable via
Options page when moving to production.

---

## Implementation Order

1. Google Cloud Console — register OAuth client, get client ID (~15 min, one-time)
2. `api.py` — Flask endpoint + `/health` check + systemd service file
3. `config.js` — user list, `PROD` flag, API endpoint, shared API key, Sheet ID
4. `manifest.json` + `background.js` skeleton (load unpacked, verify icon click fires)
5. `content.js` — extraction logic only (log to console, no overlay yet)
6. SPA navigation — `pushState` intercept + `popstate` listener
7. Identity detection — `getAuthToken` → userinfo → name match → log result
8. Overlay UI — inject panel with all fields pre-filled, overlay guard, no submit yet
9. Fetch + response handling — 10s timeout → Flask API → Google Sheets fallback
10. Auto-trigger — add 4s focus delay on top of working manual flow
11. Test: Greenhouse, Lever, Workday, LinkedIn (SPA), Ashby, Indeed
